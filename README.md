# Radially_Varying_Diffusivities
 Repository for ApJ paper on radially varying diffusivities in stellar convection simulations

Notes for ipynb and file naming conventions
Strings for files end with a number. The corresponding alpha for each number is below for increasing Ra_F number. 
#1-7 is alpha = 0 , 8-14 is alpha = -0.5, 15-18 is alpha = -1, 1f-7f is fixed flux without internal heating, 22-24 is alpha = 0.5, and 1fx-7fx is fixed entropy models

For example:

The global averages file for alpha = 0.5 for Ra_F = 10^3 is "model_24_G_Avgs.dat".
